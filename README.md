I’m a mechatronics engineer and Msc. Project Management, with more than 5 years of hands-on experience in mechanical design, electronics, and rapid prototyping. I love learning and turning real-world problems into tangible solutions.

As co-founder and Director at Creatio et Innovatio SAS, I lead applied research & development and innovation projects that combine additive manufacturing, CAD (SolidWorks), electronic design (KiCad) and embedded software.

On this GitHub I publish reproducible, production-oriented projects and tools: CAD models, KiCad schematics, firmware examples, data-analysis notebooks, and prototyping utilities.
